          About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
          Born and raised in Othello, Washington, I love to camp, read books
          and eat out. I was always the go to person for fixing anything 
          electronic for my entire family. Immediate and extended. That 
          did not however translate to any skills in coding. But I still
          became a programming prodigy at the young age of 20. The best in 
          the world in every language known to man. Even made a few of my 
          own. I would make an amazing contribution to any team.
